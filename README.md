# Arrows

- [x] Copy the necessary emojis in the project
- [x] Create a toggle to select one or more arrows at a time
- [x] Have multiple toggles in the editor, growing the array automatically on modifying arrows close to the end
- [x] Add bootstrap to the project
- [x] Put the editor in a column, having some random text on the right to it
- [x] Parameterize editor component by the arrows, making it possible to have doubles and singles editors at the same time. Add doubles editor to the second column
- [x] Create pattern types, single and double with identificator and set of arrow props to render
- [x] Add a type chooser, which should change the type of the editor
- [x] Move the state of pattern editor upward, make sure that the current bug is fixed
- [x] Implement a prompt before allowing to change the type if the pattern is non-empty.
- [x] Implement saving patterns (via downloading JSON file)
- [ ] Implement loading patterns (via file input? Figure out a way)
- [ ] Create arrows viewer component, just showing them statically at the moment (have offset as parameter, would be used for the next task)
- [ ] Create table-based practice mode a la Synthesia, advancing the pattern only on correct key presses
- [ ] Implement a way to customize keybinds of the practice tool
- [ ] Implement touchscreen controls for the practice tool, and make sure it looks decent on iPad
- [ ] Create simple arrow transformations: breaking the sequence with and without repetitions
- [ ] Blank Vite project has a bunch of recommendations in README.md on what to do before deployment, check them out before deploying it anywhere
