# Arrows

- [x] Copy the necessary emojis in the project
- [x] Create a toggle to select one or more arrows at a time
- [ ] Have multiple toggles in the editor, growing the array automatically on modifying arrows close to the end
- [ ] Create arrows viewer component, just showing them statically at the moment
- [ ] Create simple arrow transformations: breaking the sequence with and without repetitions
- [ ] Blank Vite project has a bunch of recommendations in README.md on what to do before deployment, check them out before deploying it anywhere
