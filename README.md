- [x] Copy the necessary emojis in the project
- [x] Create a toggle to select one or more arrows at a time
- [x] Have multiple toggles in the editor, growing the array automatically on modifying arrows close to the end
- [x] Add bootstrap to the project
- [x] Put the editor in a column, having some random text on the right to it
- [x] Parameterize editor component by the arrows, making it possible to have doubles and singles editors at the same time. Add doubles editor to the second column
- [ ] Create pattern types, single and double with identificator and set of arrow props to render
- [ ] Implement saving patterns (via downloading JSON file)
- [ ] Implement loading patterns (via file input? Figure out a way)
- [ ] Create arrows viewer component, just showing them statically at the moment
- [ ] Create simple arrow transformations: breaking the sequence with and without repetitions
